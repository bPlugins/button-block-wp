/**
 * Cleans the babel-makepot JS POT (generated during `npm run build`) before the
 * i18n-pot script merges it into the main POT:
 *
 * 1. Drops entries that only come from ../bpl-tools - those use their own text
 *    domain and are excluded from the PHP-side extraction for the same reason.
 * 2. Rewrites every reference to `build/index.js:1` so `wp i18n make-json`
 *    files the strings under the editor bundle's script handle. Strings shared
 *    with the other bundles keep their build/* references from wp-cli's own
 *    scan, so they land in every JSON that needs them.
 *
 * Runs in place on languages/button-block-js.pot.
